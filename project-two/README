You have retrieved the following files:

	header.mak		For recreating the Makefile

	clipPolygon.c		Skeleton for clipPolygon()
	drawFilledPolygon.c	Skeleton for drawFilledPolygon()
	drawLine.c		Skeleton for drawLine()

	support.c		Support routines used by other test files
	testline1.c		Simple tests of drawLine()
	testclip1.c		Simple tests of clipPolygon()
	testfill1.c		Simple tests of drawFilledPolygon()
	testfill2.c		More interesting tests of drawFilledPolygon()

This version of header.mak contains the proper -I option to allow the
compiler to find the header files used by these source files
(clipPolygon.h, drawFilledPolygon.h, drawLine.h, and support.h); note
that they must be included with the <> form of the #include statement -
e.g., #include <drawLine.h> - in your code.

To use these:

	* Replace the bodies of the functions in the clipPolygon.c,
	  drawFilledPolygon.c, and drawLine.c files with your
	  implementation

	* Run "makemake > Makefile".

	* Run "make".

	* Run the various test programs.
