This directory contains test files for project 2, as follows:

	c/			Directory with C versions of demos
	cpp/			Directory with C++ versions of demos

	header.mak		For recreating the Makefile

	clipPolygon.h		Prototype for clipPolygon()
	drawFilledPolygon.h	Prototype for drawFilledPolygon()
	drawLine.h		Prototype for the drawLine()
	support.h		Prototypes for various support routines

	clipPolygon.skel	Skeleton for clipPolygon()
	drawFilledPolygon.skel	Skeleton for drawFilledPolygon()
	drawLine.skel		Skeleton for drawLine()

	support.src		Support routines used by other test files
	testline1.src		Simple tests of drawLine()
	testclip1.src		Simple tests of clipPolygon()
	testfill1.src		Simple tests of drawFilledPolygon()
	testfill2.src		More interesting tests of drawFilledPolygon()

Note that the executables come in two forms - x86 and SPARC - for use on
the appropriate types of systems.

This version of header.mak contains the proper -I option to allow the
compiler to find these four header files if you #include them using the
<> form - e.g., #include <drawLine.h> - in your code.

Each of the .skel and .src files can be compiled as either C or C++.
The compiled versions of the demo programs in the subdirectories were,
in fact, compiled from these .src files using Sun's 'cc' and 'CC' compilers
(with, of course, "fleshed out" versions of the .skel files).

To use these:

	* Copy all the .src and .skel files into your working directory,
	  and change the .src and .skel suffix to .c, .C, or .cpp
	  (according to your personal preference).  DO NOT COPY THE .h
	  FILES.  Note - you must be sure to copy in the support.src
	  file, as it contains several routines used by the other test
	  files.

	* Copy the header.mak file into your working directory.

	* Replace the bodies of the functions in the (former) .skel
	  files with your implementations.

	* Run "makemake > Makefile".

	* Run "make".

	* Run the various test programs.
