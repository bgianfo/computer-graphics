Part 2 - Summary

Write a two-page summary (roughly 120 to 140 lines)  which discusses
the three (or more) video segments you watched.  Be sure to consider
(at least) the following issues:

	* What is the quality of the image - is it jagged, smooth, etc.?

	* Is the image solid or wire-frame?

	* Is the 3-D image a real 3-D or a faked one using 2-D?
	  Support your answer (i.e., what clues did you use?).

	* How is color used?

	* Is there animation?

	* How complex are the images?

	* How has computer graphics changed over the years represented
	  here?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

All three video's were for the most part smooth animations and had very few if 
any jagged edges. I felt like "Luxo Jr." and "HELPER Z" had the most advanced 
quality out of my three selections, despite it's age.  The lighting, shadows, 
and the overall quality of the geometry is far better than "Pencil Test".
I expected the quality of "Pencil Test" to be far worse than it was, the fact 
that it was entirely mad on an Apple II amazed me.  The quality vs. computing 
power for that time period is very impressive to me. It seems like most other 
features in Electronic Theater around this time were rendered on large super 
computers. The geometry for the most part wasn't incredibly complex.
"HELPER Z"'s quality seemed to fluctuate throughout the segment. The big 
open city scenes were very impressive and very nice quality, however the 
zoomed in character scenes I felt had a significantly lesser quality, they 
lacked important shadows, or maybe a certain physical depth to the character?

All of the segment's were solid images, no wire-frame's. All characters in "Luxo Jr."
were solid desk lamps. "Pencil Test" had a pencil built out of rectangles and 
various other office desk like objects. "HELPER Z" has robots, humans, cars and 
a beautifully rendered city scape I believe that "Luxo Jr.", "Pencil Test", 
"HELPER Z" are all real 3-D image. I believe this because of how the shadows are
cast in all the segments, as well as the shading of colors on objects. Their
was an obvious depth to all of three segments. 

Colors in all of the three segments colors were used in conjunction with 
shading/blending. "HELPER Z" obviously had the most advanced usage of shading
because of it's recent release date. Yet the colors in "Luxo Jr." were far more
vibrant and life like than the dull bland colors used in "Pencil Test". I believe 
this is probably because of the advanced shading that was able to be done on the 
hardware that Luxo Jr. was rendered on. 

All three segments did indeed have animation, all very good smooth, intricate 
animation. Pencil Test again was lacking in this area, not so smooth. One thing that
was mentioned in class but I noticed again was the emotion depicted in "Luxo Jr.". 
The intricate movements of the figures and the way they move definitely convey's a lot
of emotion you would have never really thought an inanimate object could have. I had 
a similar feeling when viewing "HELPER Z" except that a human was portraying emotion in 
a very conflicting way instead of an inanimate object.

"HELPER Z" was a very complex animation, including city scapes, humans and robots. 
The city had stop lights, roof's for door-way's and intricate trimmings for window panes.
The human character has an animated face, conveying emotion and showing fear, dangling in 
the wind of the city. The robot it self in the segment is also a very detailed model.
"Luxo Jr." and "Pencil Test" were not as complex but still fairly involved. "Pencil Test"
used a office desk as it's main scene which had a bunch of different objects on it. 
The actual storyboard for "Pencil Test" was most likely far more complicated than that of
"HELPER Z". "Pencil Test" has a more involved story and is arguably more complex if you 
compare them by giving a handicap for the year they were created. 

I feel like the three selections clearly showed a progression in computer graphics through
the years. The overall basic concepts have stayed the same for the most part. However
The advancement in rendering technology and physical hardware has enabled us to do things
previously unthinkable because of lack of computing power. The increase in detail and 
general photo realise is where the segments point me too. With better shading and modelling 
and rendering tools the image and quality of the films increased greatly. Models in "Pencil Test"
were more or less rounded basic geometric shapes drawn together to represent a familiar object.
Where in contrast in "HELPER Z" all objects were full models using multiple types of non traditional
geometry to represent a object in more detail and in a far more realistic way than was possible 
in the early 1989. 


It wasn't very clear if all of the production on "Pencil Test" was done on an Apple II or
If all production,animation and rendering were done on a single Apple II. Or possibly even
multiple Apple II's working in conjunction with each other. Given the time period I find it
kind of hard to believe they could render that amount of data in a timely fashion on that 
kind of hardware.

It's also very interesting how back in the day all feature's were created with pretty much 
custom animation tools. Where as now we have two or three main players in the game that 
a large amount of all animations are created with that aren't HUGE studio productions. 
It kind of shows how far we've come with the technology.
