Camera Info:
------------

 #1) "Zoomed out" 90 degree field of view angle looking at 0,0,0.
 Near clip 0.1 , far clip 100.0

 #2) "Normal" 35 degree field of view angle looking at 0,0,0. 
     Near clip 0.1 , far clip 100.0

 #3) "Zoomed in" eye at 2,2,2  looking at 0,0,0 with a normal up vector (y)

Lighting:
---------
 GL_LIGHT0) Position: x: 3.0 y: 3.0 z: 3.0    0.0
			Specular: r: 1.0 g: 1.0 b: 1.0 a: 1.0

 GL_LIGHT1) Position: x: -3.0 y: -3.0 z: 3.0    1.0
	 		Specular: r: 1.0  g: 1.0  b: 1.0 a: 1.0

Material:
 	- Material 1 for all sphere's is very shiny, non emissive, no ambient
	  or diffuse. Everything ramped up for specular

 	- Material 2 for the Teapost is shiny, non emissive,
	  ambient and diffuse in red spectrum.. Everything ramped up for specular 

	- Material 3 for the Teapot stand, slightly emmisve in all colors.
	  Ambient and diffuse with red. not very shiny. 

	- Material 4 for the donought, very emmissive of red.
	  No ambient or diffuse., Everything ramped for specular.


Texture Map
-----------
	- Texture #1, a metal looking texture in TGA format used on Teapot only. 

	- Texture #2, a grid looking texture in TGA format used on all the sphere's
	  (large and small)

Rotation:
---------
	- Teapot: the Teapot is rotating around it's Y axis

	- All large sphere's: the collective is rotating  around the teapot on x and y and z

	- Large Sphere's Individually: each large sphere is rotating on it's x and y axis.

	- All small sphere's: the collective is rotating in the inverse direction around it's parent large
	sphere on x and y and z.

	- Small Sphere's: each small sphere is rotating on x and y

Translation:
------------
	- Donought: The donought is being translated up and down by translating on
	  the y axis. 

Scaling:
--------
	- Donought: The donought is being scaled in the y direction corresponding
	  wiht it's current y-axis value.
